make signal stuff work
multiple result sets (SQLMoreResults)
batch mode?
tab completion - commands as a minimum, maybe tables etc too?
regression tests using SQLite
separate history by DSN?
multi-line history items get split when history is loaded from file
newlines in data break horizontal display
specify editor as argument to \e? (or named buffer?)
commands which don't return result sets could be actions instead, eg \r for reconnect
interpret single chars on a line as actions? (eg q) - configurable
guile support?
better portability - for one thing, make readline optional
ncurses / locale-aware display mode (can handle tabs, multibyte chars etc)
ODBC unicode mode?
copyright message and version on startup
redirects and pipes don't work for \p
replace calls to getenv with rc_get or similar to avoid hardcoded prefix

prepared statement support:
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE id = ?
\g 1
\g 2
etc

commands:
*autocommit on|off
