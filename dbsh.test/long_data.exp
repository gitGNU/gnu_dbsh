    "data\r\nIf it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well\r\nIt were done quickly: if the assassination\r\nCould trammel up the consequence, and catch\r\nWith his surcease success; that but this blow\r\nMight be the be-all and the end-all here,\r\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\r\nWe'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases\r\nWe still have judgment here; that we but teach\r\nBloody instructions, which, being taught, return\r\nTo plague the inventor: this even-handed justice\r\nCommends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice\r\nTo our own lips. He's here in double trust;\r\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\r\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\r\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\r\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\r\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\r\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\r\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\r\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\r\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\r\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed\r\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\r\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\r\nThat tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur\r\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\r\nVaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself\r\nAnd falls on the other.\r\n\r\n"
