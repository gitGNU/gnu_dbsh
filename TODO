make signal stuff work
multiple result sets (SQLMoreResults)
batch mode?
tab completion - commands as a minimum, maybe tables etc too?
regression tests using SQLite
separate history by DSN?
multi-line history items get split when history is loaded from file
specify editor as argument to \e? (or named buffer?)
commands which don't return result sets could be actions instead, eg \r for reconnect
interpret single chars on a line as actions? (eg q) - configurable
guile support?
ODBC unicode mode?
replace calls to getenv with rc_get or similar to avoid hardcoded prefix
pager gets run even if no result set is generated (is this a problem?)
more consistency in error handling (less random perrors and printfs)
tidy up function names

aliases/prepared statements
*alias getrow SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE id = ?;
*getrow 1;
*getrow 2;
etc
+ some way to save them for future use

commands:
*autocommit on|off
*help
